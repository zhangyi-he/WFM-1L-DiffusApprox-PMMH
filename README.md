# Estimating temporally variable selection intensity from ancient DNA data
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring temporally variable selection from ancient DNA data (in format of genotype likelihoods), and the preprint has been submitted to Molecular Biology and Evolution, available at https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.01.502345.

[Code v1.0](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.0) includes the source code implemented for the case of constant natural selection and constant demographic histories with called genotypes as input.

[Code v1.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.1) includes the source code implemented for the case of constant natural selection and non-constant demographic histories with called genotypes as input.

[Code v1.2](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.2) / [Code v1.2.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.2.1) includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant natural selection and non-constant demographic histories with called genotypes as input. Note that [Code v1.2.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.2.1) provides a version that no loss or fixation event occurred in the underlying population.

[Code v1.3](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.3) includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant natural selection and non-constant demographic histories with called genotypes as input, where the underlying frequency trajectory of the mutant allele in the population is jointly estiamted.

[Code v1.4](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.4) / [Code v1.4.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.4.1) includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant natural selection and non-constant demographic histories with genotype likelihoods as input, where the underlying frequency trajectory of the mutant allele in the population is jointly estiamted. Note that [Code v1.4.1](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.4.1) provides a more computationally efficient version.

[Code v1.5](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Code%20v1.5) includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant natural selection and non-constant demographic histories with genotype likelihoods as input, where the dominance parameter and the underlying frequency trajectory of the mutant allele in the population are jointly estiamted.

[Data](https://github.com/zhangyi-he/WFM-1L-DiffusApprox-PMMH/tree/main/Data) includes the ancient horse samples genotyped at the loci for coat colouration.
