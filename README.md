# Estimating temporally variable selection intensity from ancient DNA data
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring temporally variable selection from ancient DNA data (in format of genotype likelihoods), and the preprint has been submitted to Molecular Biology and Evolution, available at

Code v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case of constant natural selection and constant demographic histories with called genotypes as input.
